Mongo Music is a refactoring exercise.

The app lets you manage a list of tracks and 'listen' to them, with persistance to a CSV (later a YAML file).

The repository starts with the app implemented as a single file, with not methods and functions.

We then started to write tests and to refactor.


Initially, you would run the app by:
> ruby music_database.rb

Once we started writing tests, you run tests by:
> rspec

and run the actual app using:
> ruby run.rb
