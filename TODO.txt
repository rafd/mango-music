refactoring:
 - we started converting track_arrays (which we received from the CSV) into hashes; now that Database supports saving hashes, clean up the remaining code
 - create and use an Interface class or module (instead of just a run method) (+ add tests for the class)
 - create and use a MongoMusic class that has a method for each command that our app supports (+ add tests for the class)
 - use a Track class and instances for passing tracks around instead of hashes (+ add tests for the class)

new features:
 - add support for albums
 - add the "stats <artist>" command, that lists all songs by an artist
 - allow delete of tracks
 - handle unexpected input
